# Bayesian-Network-bnlearn-Naive-Bayes-
Creation of Bayesian Network from data using bnlearn library also include Naive Bayes Classifier implementation

This lab is designed to introduce you the use of Bayesian Network and Naı̈ve Bayes
algorithm. By the end of this lab session you will:
• Learn how to construct Bayesian Network from data.
• Learn how to implement Naı̈ve Bayes algorithm for classification tasks.
• Learn how to use Bayesian Network and Naı̈ve Bayes for inference.
